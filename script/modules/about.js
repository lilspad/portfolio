const text1 = "Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Lily, a software engineer learning, creating and enjoying life in London.<br><br> As any good escapist I love films, games and music, but I also have an abnormal creativity level which leads me to make... well, anything from bread to knitwear to websites. I've worked in the coffee industry for almost 7 years, so I can also make a great pick-me-up in a mug. However, I decided to finally leave hospitality to pursue a career in tech.";

const text2 = "I first came face-to-face with coding in school, where I did extracurricular computer science. I learned Python basics I still remember to this day. Then I began a self-study journey in 2021, with many disruptions due to work-life (un)balance. Using resources across the web I learned how to build websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as their many extensions, libraries and frameworks. I then completed a bootcamp with OpenClassrooms, where I learnt to make my code more efficient and maintainable. Now I'm building new projects and improving on my skills while looking for my first professional role in the industry.";
